receipts of when I need to debug my code for the digital clock project.
1. When the clock does not display the correct time.
2. When the clock freezes or becomes unresponsive.
3. When the alarm function does not trigger at the set time.
4. When the user interface elements do not update as expected.
5. When there are errors in the console related to time calculations.
6. When the clock does not synchronize with an external time source.
7. When the display format (12-hour vs 24-hour) does not change correctly.
8. When the clock does not handle daylight saving time changes properly.
9. When the clock's battery backup does not function during a power outage.
10. When the clock's settings do not save or load correctly after a restart.
11. When the clock's brightness adjustment does not work as intended.
12. When the clock's sound settings (volume, tone) do not apply correctly.
13. When the clock's date display is incorrect or does not update.
14. When the clock's timer or stopwatch functions do not operate correctly.
15. When the clock's firmware update process fails or causes issues.
16. When the clock's connectivity features (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) do not function.
17. When the clock's notifications or alerts do not appear as expected.
18. When the clock's power consumption is higher than expected.
19. When the clock's physical buttons or touch controls do not respond.
20. When the clock's overall performance is sluggish or slow to respond.
21. When the clock's visual design elements do not render correctly.
22. When the clock's integration with other smart home devices fails.
23. When the clock's user manual or help documentation is unclear or incorrect.
24. When the clock's localization or language settings do not apply correctly.
25. When the clock's backup and restore functions do not work as intended.
26. When the clock's error handling does not provide useful feedback.
27. When the clock's display flickers or has visual artifacts.
28. When the clock's time zone settings do not adjust correctly.
29. When the clock's firmware or software crashes unexpectedly.
30. When the clock's overall user experience is not intuitive or user-friendly.
These are the scenarios where I need to debug my digital clock project to ensure it functions correctly and provides a good user experience.
Here are 30 scenarios or reasons why debugging is essential for my digital clock project.
